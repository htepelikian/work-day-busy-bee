# work-day-busy-bee

This project consists of combining HTML, CSS, and JS to make a dynamic tool: the work day planner! When the user arrives to the web page, they are able to see time blocks indicating the time of the day: gray for past, green for future, and red for present. The user is able to click into the given time slot and enter any text they'd like. When the user clicks the save button, given in blue on the right-hand side, they are able to save the written text. The text will appear even after the user refreshes the page.
